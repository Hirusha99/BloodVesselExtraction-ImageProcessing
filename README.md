# Extracting Blood Vessels Using some Image Processing Techniques

Extracting blood vessels using image processing techniques involves employing various algorithms and tools to identify and isolate blood vessel structures from medical images, such as retinal or angiographic images. 
These techniques typically include processes like image enhancement, noise reduction, and segmentation. Image enhancement methods improve the quality of the image, making vessels more distinguishable. 
Noise reduction techniques help eliminate unwanted artefacts that can hinder accurate analysis. 
Segmentation algorithms separate the blood vessels from the background and other structures, creating a binary map highlighting the vessel network.
